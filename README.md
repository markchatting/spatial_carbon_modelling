# spatial_carbon_modelling
Spatial modelling of organic carbon density in surficial marine sediment.

Scripts should be run in this order:

  1)  library_setup.R
  
  2)  response_data.R
    a)  I have uploaded a folder "datasets" to the QUEST WP2 spatial predictive modelling shared folder. This folder has all the datasets required for this         script.
  3)  Predictor_data.R
  4)  train_model.R
  5)  Inference_predictor_data.R
  6)  Inference.R
  7)  Area_of_Applicability
